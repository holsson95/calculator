# calculator
Odin project to make an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
I wanted to focus more on the javascript aspect of this project so I used a guide in creating the calculator portion
CSS and HTML guide from https://dev.to/anitamaity/how-to-make-a-calculator-using-only-html-and-css-12ol

Current bugs and additions with the calculator to fix later: 
1. Further operations to the calculator after = is pressed are incorrect due to the variable being stored twice 
2. Did not include error messages yet for dividing 0 
3. There are no decimal values yet.
